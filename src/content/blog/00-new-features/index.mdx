import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import ContentImage from "@components/ContentImage.astro";
import advertisingLists from "./advertising_lists_added-1024x215.jpg";
import computerPhoto from "./271393489_7450028155022821_6941861915229160164_n-768x1024.jpg";

**Things I need to do**

- adjust heading spacing in markdown. h1 vs h2 vs h3 etc
- footer: equidistant

## Example Content

I want to show what things would look like in a blog post form.

I am trying to link to [the docs for Astro here](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)

Example text to see how a paragraph is rendered. Below is a code block
that shows how a codeblock is rendered. It looks pretty good imo.

```javascript
// example.js
const jack = "jack";
let mouse = "mx master 4";

mouse = "lg g pro";
```

example file

```bash
sudo ls -la
```

## New ContentImage Component

I've added a custom `ContentImage` component (`src/components/ContentImage.astro`) to make it easier to render images in blog posts with consistent styling. The component provides:

- **Rounded corners** - Automatically applies rounded styling to images
- **Captions** - Optional caption support displayed below images
- **Flexible imports** - Works with both imported images and URL strings

### Usage

```jsx
import ContentImage from "@components/ContentImage.astro";
import myPhoto from "./my-photo.jpg";

<ContentImage src={myPhoto} alt="Description of image" caption="Optional caption text" />;
```

For remote images, you'll need to specify width and height:

```jsx
<ContentImage
  src="https://example.com/image.jpg"
  alt="Remote image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  caption="Image from external source"
/>
```

### ContentImage Example

Here's the ContentImage component in action with an imported image and caption:

<ContentImage
  src={computerPhoto}
  alt="Front face of computer"
  caption="The front face of my computer"
/>

Here is a an image that is loaded from a URL:

<ContentImage
  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519052537078-e6302a4968d4?q=80&w=2340&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"
  alt="Remote image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  caption="Image from external source"
/>

The component automatically handles styling, adds rounded corners, and displays the caption in a consistent format below the image.

## Disabled Legal Pages

The Terms and Privacy pages are currently disabled but preserved for future use. They've been disabled by:

- Adding `.disabled` extension to page route: `src/pages/legal/[...slug].astro.disabled`
- Adding `.disabled` extension to content: `privacy.md.disabled` and `terms.md.disabled`
- Commenting out footer links in `src/components/Footer.astro`

**To re-enable:** Remove the `.disabled` extension from all three files and uncomment the legal links section in the footer (see comment in file for instructions).

This approach works for any page/route you want to temporarily disable while keeping the code intact.
