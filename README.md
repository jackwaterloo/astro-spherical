# Astro Spherical

This is an astro template meant to display blog posts and projects.

Based off [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere) - a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast theme built primarily with Astro, Tailwind and TypeScript, with a small amount of SolidJS for stateful components.

- **Hero Images** - Support for hero images in blog posts and content previews
- **ContentImage Component** - Consistent image styling with captions for MDX content
